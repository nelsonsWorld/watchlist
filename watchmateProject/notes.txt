1. What does "iterable" mean?
2. DRF video "Creating JSON Response- All Elements"- Complex Query Result > Python Dictionary > JSON Response
3. Serialization and Deserialization. two types serializers.serializers, serializers.ModelSerializer
4. Function based views/Class based views (import APIView class).
5. Working with API > DRF Browsable API, Postman, HTTPie.
6. When you want multiple objects, "many = True" in the MovieSerializer attribute.
7. Explain function " return Movie.objects.create(**validated_data)" and why needs "**".
## WHEN DOING TOKEN AUTHENTICATION, THE CONSTANT DB CHECK FOR TOKEN CAN BE AN ISSUE ONCE YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF USERS ACCESSING YOUR SERVER##

1. functions based views, Class based views, generic views with mixins, generics views, concrete views, viewsets w/routers and path include router.urls
2. For blanket, global restriction, In settings.py, at the bottom below STATIC and Bigfield DB entry:
# REST_FRAMEWORK = {
#     'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
#         'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated'
#     ]
# }

3. When do you nest a response/return and when do you go to the previous indent?

          ex. if X = True :
                    if x = True:

                    return ?
                     or
             return?

MAJOR ISSUES:

stream/ doesn't show reviews in JSON, fixed: The StreamPlatform serializer was missing:

class StreamPlatformSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    watchlist = WatchListSerializer(many=True, read_only=True) <----THIS


Version 23 learned about Global and class(possibly function?) based permissions.
